I want you to make this website be a HIIT interval timer, it will be simple, have 3 fields: SETS, WORK, REST and a Start workout button that will have on the right side, inside, the total time the workout will take like: 4 SETS, 30s WORK, 2m REST => 08:00

When it starts the first 10s will be preparing, then WORK, then REST, the looping back at WORK, etc.

The SETS, WORK, REST, will have an - and + buttons to change the values, for the WORK, REST will be a -, + 5s intervals

Make the UI for the phone in mind, using shadcn and taillwind, you can install any shadcn component you need using bun.


I want the UI for when the Timer started to be different, In the middle the time ticking down for ether 10s preparing, WORK or REST, right on top of it the SETS 1/4. On top of the screen left an X button, middle the REMAINING time, and at the bottom of the screen 3 buttons: << for going back like if it's 24s left from WORK as a example it will reset it back to 30s and if it's under 5s elapsed like 26s left from WORK it will go back on set to ether REST or preparing, then in the middle a Pause/Resume button, and on the right a >> button.

Good, now remove the unnecessary parts from the setting up UI, like the reset button, current phase, Ready status, Time left.

Make the background be green when it's Work and make a shade of brighter green that is filling up the background from bottom to top as the timer is ended based on the % is done, like when Work is 30s the 0% and when is 0s is 100%, and make the background filling to be smooth to not view the steps every second when the % changes.
Make all the UI be dark theme and add a filling bg animation for REST also.

Change the filling color animation for REST to not be green and fix the UI positioning for the buttons in the "Timer started" UI to take all the page.
img, as you can see the UI does not take all the screen

When is 5s or lower, for every second and say the text using the browser text-to-speech like: 5,4,3,2,1,Work ... 5,4,3,2,1,Rest, ... etc
Add at end of it all, "Great work!" message being read by TTS.

Make the middle button Pause/Resume take more space the rest of the buttons there. And make the X button more visible.

Knowing everything, remake it from scratch better, and don't write everything in just one file.

We are going to make some big changes to make this happen, so make sure you understand the code/where we are now and make a plan before starting the work.

Under the "Start workout" button we will have a "+ Multi-exercise workout" button, when click it will go to another screen where it will have at the top a workout name text filed and a delete icon button, under that a list to show the routine/exercises and a button under "+ Add exercise", when click either "+ Add exercise" or an already there exercise, we go to another screen similar to the first TimerSetup, but this will have 3 more files, "Exercise name" instead of default Work and a REST (LAST) and lastly a delete icon button.

Now on the main screen we will have the workouts saved on top, first thing on the page: name and full time duration and an edit button. When clicked the full element, will start the workout routine, each exercise one by one in the workout.

There are 2 bugs: 
1. I can add a workout without any exercise.
2. There is a console error:

Add a good and easy way to change the order of the exercises in the workout edit menu using the HTML Drag and Drop API.


In the WorkoutCalendar remove loggedClasses, and the: Logged, No log, and add there instead 2 buttons: < and >, so you can see other months.


I want to use GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions to deploy this Bun React website, make the action workflow. Search the internet if you need to find any specifics.


I want you to add a popup mobile like, scrollable time picker when clicking directly on the time and not the - or + buttons, for Work, Rest, etc. And the time I want to be shown in mins and seconds separately not just seconds. Think hard before making any changes because this is not quite that easy.

make the max time be 60m 59s and make the s be incremented by 1 in the timepickersheet
make it so when I click outside after selecting a time, it as if I click done not cancel
remove the top: cancel, Rest duration, Done. and make it take a bit more of the screen
make it so when I go back after opening the timerpicker it will just close it
